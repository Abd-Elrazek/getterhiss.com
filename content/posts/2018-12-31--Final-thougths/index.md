#Final thoughts to 2018 - questions to ask yourself before you say 'Goodbye'

It is the last day of the year, which means if you are active in your online community or follow any blogs whatsoever, you have probably seen dozens of articles and social media posts about people's summaries of their past year - the new years resolutions kept and broken, the number of places travelled, books read, articles written, followers gained, business built and revenue gained. 

All these things *(that reach the public)* contain superficial facts that only show the tip of the iceberg.

Whereas it is great to see where you've come in a year, we should aim to dig deeper as there are many questions I think every person should ask themselves before fully putting 2018 behind.

### 1. What am I most grateful for this year?
**Gratitude is the only attitude.**

If you're on of those who believe in counting their blessings daily, you shouldn't have a problem picking out the few highlights of the year that made it what it was. 

If you're still a *newbie* to this, just think of what are the most important moments of this year that you wouldn't change - good or bad - and take a moment for appreciation. Even if you've had an extremely challenging year, I bet you can find that one moment that spurs up the feeling of joy. Just think, which achievements made this year worthwhile?

### 2. In what aspects did I grow as a person?

If you really read all the books, and made all the connections you said you did, I am sure you experienced some internal growth. That shift inside you is something you can't really put a price on. It means you are a living, ever-evolving being, that is highly connected with their surrounding world and has the capability to expand its knowledge and self-awareness.

There are so many ways to grow as a person. A year can change a lot, see who you were 365 days ago from today and where you are now. Be proud of the long way you've come.

### 3. What was my biggest failure of this year? 

**Your failures determine your success.**

Don't be so shy, or ignorant, to not admit that you've had quite a few falls this year. Sometimes a magnificent failure can be the greatest gift that leads you to the progress you've been waiting for. Make sure you take the most out of your failures *(call them experiences, if you like)* analyzing what you could've done differently to avoid or handle them better.

### 4. What was my biggest lesson learned? 

It can be a big success, a great failure, or a person who taught us a lesson. Sometimes learning a lesson can hurt a lot *(especially true with kids)*, but it makes us a better and smarter person.
The biggest lesson can also be the reminder to appreciate the time with your family and loved ones more, since we never know how much time we have left.

### 5. Who else stands behind my success this year, the person who gave me the most support?
Behind every successful person, there is someone strong who helped them to become who they are by supporting them, sharing advice, cheering them up, motivating, giving a good kick in the but if needed, or perhaps simply being there and sharing a friendly hug when needed. 

Even the most successful people in the world *([like Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-commencement-speech-2017-5))* admit that they could not have done it with those other people in their life who gave their hand in guidance.

### 6. Did I manage to overcome my fears?

**Fears kill more dreams than failure ever will.**

I know personally, that the lack of skills has never held me back as much as my fears have.
While failure is often our biggest fear, we forget to consider that the biggest failure of them all is failing to try at all.
All it often takes is just going beyond our fears, our comfort zone, to reach what we truly want. 

### 7. Which habits did I kick (off) that I am proud of?

**Habits are the atoms of our lives.**

While it's great to work out, eat healthy and meditate daily, there are many smaller habits that form our personality, our daily routine and finally our success. It takes a lot of work and determination to change the old patterns.

It only takes that one day to start (and it doesn't have to be the first day of the year, or week), and another 364 days of continuous practice and reminders to keep going in the right direction. Nothing great or lasting happens overnight.

### 8. How did I improve someone elses life?

**It's nice to be important but it's even more important to be nice.**

Besides improving your own skills, nurturing your own health and career, when did you help others in order to do the same? 
One of the keys to happiness is sharing your own success and wealth with others. It doesn't necessarily take a grand gesture to make a change.


##Finally..

These are just some of the thoughts I have had and would like to put on other minds too, since life can't always be summarized by a set of numbers.
And in the end of this crazy beautiful year..
### with all my heart, wherever you are, I wish you a Happy New year! ⭐️
